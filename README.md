# Incubator Proposal
Building up a project on solar PV in the United States.

Progress:
- Created repository, found initial data set from the Open PV Project (July 2017)
- Obtained data on electric utility rates for 2013-2015 (August 2017)
- Found income returns by zip code (August 2017)
- Found incentives by state, county, and city (August 2017)

To Do:
- Data on income, rates, and incentives are all in different formats and need to be cleaned/shaped
- Try clustering to determine typologies of solar installers based on incentives, rates, and income

Ideal visualizations:
- Zip code maps by state of income and installations
